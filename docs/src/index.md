## Dielectrics Materials

Dielectrics and Conductors: This includes perfect (lossless) dielectrics, conductive (lossy) materials, and perfect electric conductors.
- Dielectric constant

## Dispersive Materials

Dispersive (frequency-dependent) materials can correctly describe the physics behind the optical responses.
- Dielectric constant of free electron gas
- Drude model: describes intraband electron motion.
- Lorentz oscillator model: describes interband electron transitions.
- Debye model: describes the relaxation of atomic vibrations.
- Coleâ€“Cole model
- Cole-Davidson
- Havriliak-Negami

## Arbitrarily-accurate Models

The arbitrarily-accurate (albeit, perhaps unphysical) fits to experimental optical data can be obtained.

- multi-pole Debye model with static conductivity
- Drude model in combination with multiple Lorentz oscillator poles
- Interpolation of tabulated data
